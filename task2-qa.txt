Q1. how does a git workflow flows?
	wrokspace -----> staging area ----> local repo ----> remote repo
	     ---(add)-->        ---(commit)-->       ---(push)--->
	     ------------(commit -a)--------->
	     <---------(merge)----------------       <----(fetch)----
             <-------------------(pull)-----------------------------
Q2. Different stages of a git project?
	1. add: The git add adds the files from the developers working 
		space or working directory to the staging area.
	2. commit: The git commit cmd takes a screenshort of the code
		 at that point in time which means that after commiting 
		the repo the git keeps a track of all the changes we make 
		in it.
	3. push: The push command pushes the files from local repository to 
		remote repository. Revetrs files or commits from local commits 
		to remote server.
	4. fetch: The fetch is a converse of push ie. imports commits to 
		local branch .
	5. status: See the current status of our repo
	6. diff: to see the difference between the versions of code.

Q3  Is it possible to do git commit before git add?
	yes the command git commit -a transforms the workspace contents 
	to local repo directly.
