Q1. how does a git workflow flows?
	wrokspace -----> staging area ----> local repo ----> remote repo
	     ---(add)-->        ---(commit)-->       ---(push)--->
	     ------------(commit -a)--------->
	     <---------(merge)----------------       <----(fetch)----
             <-------------------(pull)-----------------------------
Q2. Different stages of a git project?
	1. add: The git add adds the files from the developers working 
		space or working directory to the staging area.
	2. commit: The git commit cmd takes a screenshort of the code
		 at that point in time which means that after commiting 
		the repo the git keeps a track of all the changes we make 
		in it.
	3. push: The push command pushes the files from local repository to 
		remote repository. Revetrs files or commits from local commits 
		to remote server.
	4. fetch: The fetch is a converse of push ie. imports commits to 
		local branch .
	5. status: See the current status of our repo
	6. diff: to see the difference between the versions of code.

Q3  Is it possible to do git commit before git add?
	no, we can not do that. It will show error of untracked files
     "nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)"

Q4. why git diff is used?
	 to see if some changes are made or not to our files.
	It gives the differences we made in the git repo.
Q5 Can the commmit msg be blank ?
	 IT can be left blank but its a good development practice to 
	add some message.
